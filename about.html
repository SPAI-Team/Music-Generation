            The entire system is powered by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A
            neural network is an AI model loosely inspired by how our brains
            work, where the neurons in our brain take in signals and produce
            responses based on these signals. The neural network is taught by
            letting it experience multiple training examples. It then evaluates
            its ability to give the correct output. Finally, it learns from its
            experience and improves itself.

            An RNN is just a type of neural network that can make predictions
            based on prior inputs in a sequence provided to it. More
            specifically, we trained the RNN to predict the next note in a piano
            performance, given the information on the past notes that were
            played by the user. So, what happens when you play our piano?

            As you play the notes, we record down the notes you play, and feed
            it into the model. Once the model is active, it uses the notes
            played by the user to generate an output of list of probabilities of
            the next note that is to be played. From there, the note with the
            highest probability would be selected and played by the AI. It then
            takes the note that it just played and feeds it back into the RNN,
            generating the next note in the sequence.
